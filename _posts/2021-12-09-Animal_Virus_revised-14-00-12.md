<p>This is a slightly revised model of the discontinued "Animal Virus" kit. This version allows the central helix (representing DNA) to be attached to the capsid with the use of only standard parts (two B00 struts) and much less flexing than in the original design. Although only one of the two "anchor" struts is a true B00 (2.86 cm) in this model, the other anchoring strut is of very similar size - 2.44 cm; the central helix compresses more than enough to allow for construction of the physical model.</p>
